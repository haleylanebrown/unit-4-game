# Crystal Collector Game

This game is my Unit 4 homework submission for Denver University's Coding Bootcamp.

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive game where the HTML is dynamically updated using jQuery.

## How to Play:
- A random target score is generated on the page.
- Four gems are also displayed as buttons, each with a different hidden value.
- Each time the player clicks on a button, that hidden value is added to their score.
- If the player matches their score to the target score, they win the game!
- When the game is restarted, a new target score and gem values are assigned.

## Design Notes:
- Gem buttons are assigned a number between 1 - 12
- Random number generated is a number between 19 - 120
